## Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone project replicates the core functionality of Airbnb, providing a platform where users can list properties, browse accommodations, make bookings, and leave reviews.

### 1. User Management
Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles. Authentication and authorization ensure secure access, while roles (guest, host, admin) define what actions each user can perform.

### 2. Property Management
Hosts can list new properties, including details like location, description, and pricing. They can also update or remove their listings, making it easy to manage accommodations over time.

### 3. Booking System
Guests can search for available properties and make bookings for specific dates. The system calculates the total cost and ensures that overlapping bookings are prevented.

### 4. Reviews & Ratings
Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties they‚Äôve stayed in. This builds trust in the platform and helps future guests make informed decisions.

### 5. Payments
Bookings are tied to a payment system, allowing guests to securely pay for their reservations. Payment records are linked to bookings and users to track financial transactions.

### 6. Search & Filtering
Guests can search for properties based on criteria like location, price range, and availability. This makes it easy to find the most relevant accommodations.

### 7. Admin Dashboard (optional/extended feature)
Admins can oversee users, properties, and bookings, helping to moderate the platform and maintain quality service.

## API Security

Securing the backend APIs is critical to protect sensitive user information, financial transactions, and the overall integrity of the system.  
The following measures will be implemented:

### 1. Authentication
- **What it is:** Verifies the identity of users (e.g., using JWT tokens, OAuth2, or session-based authentication).
- **Why it‚Äôs important:** Ensures that only registered and verified users can access protected endpoints, helping to protect user accounts and prevent unauthorized access.

### 2. Authorization
- **What it is:** Controls what actions an authenticated user can perform (e.g., role-based access control for guests, hosts, and admins).
- **Why it‚Äôs important:** Prevents users from accessing data or performing actions outside their permissions (e.g., a guest cannot modify another host‚Äôs property).

### 3. Data Encryption
- **What it is:** Encrypting sensitive data both in transit (via HTTPS/TLS) and at rest (database-level encryption).
- **Why it‚Äôs important:** Protects personal data, passwords, and payment details from being intercepted or leaked.

### 4. Rate Limiting & Throttling
- **What it is:** Restricts the number of API requests a user or client can make in a certain timeframe.
- **Why it‚Äôs important:** Prevents abuse such as brute-force attacks and ensures system stability under heavy load.

### 5. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **What it is:** Validates and sanitizes user input before processing.
- **Why it‚Äôs important:** Protects against common attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and malicious payloads.

### 6. Secure Payments
- **What it is:** Integration with trusted third-party payment gateways that follow PCI DSS compliance.
- **Why it‚Äôs important:** Ensures that sensitive financial transactions are processed securely and not exposed to potential breaches.

---

By implementing these security measures, the platform protects **user data, financial integrity, and trust**, ensuring that both guests and hosts can use the system safely.


## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines automate the process of building, testing, and deploying the application.  
This ensures that code changes are integrated smoothly, tested consistently, and deployed quickly without manual intervention.

### Why CI/CD is important
- **Consistency:** Every new feature or fix is tested automatically, reducing the risk of bugs reaching production.  
- **Speed:** Automates repetitive tasks such as running tests, building Docker images, and deploying updates.  
- **Reliability:** Ensures that deployments are predictable and reproducible.  
- **Collaboration:** Makes it easier for multiple developers to contribute without breaking the main branch.  

### Tools Used
- **GitHub Actions:** For automating workflows such as running tests, linting, and deployments whenever code is pushed.  
- **Docker:** To containerize the application for consistent environments across development, staging, and production.  
- **(Optional) AWS / Heroku / Vercel:** For hosting and automatically deploying the latest version of the app.

By using CI/CD pipelines, the Airbnb Clone project ensures faster delivery, higher quality code, and a smoother developer experience.
